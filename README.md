Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering methods and principles ad tools to develop and maintain software products and solutions


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Key milestones in the evolution of Software engineering are as follows
- The establishement of software enginnering as a discipline in 1960s
- The advent of structured programming in 1970s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements- This is the stage for gathering and documenting user needs and the system requirements.
- Design- creating a high level and  detailed designs of the software architechture and user interface.
- Implementation/ Development- this is the stage where the actual writing of code is done. The software building is done according to the design specifications.
- Testing- the built solution is tested to ensure it meets the quality standards and the required fuctionality as per the user requirements
- Deplyoment- Releasing the software to the end users
- Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after release to the end users.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall approach is a develelopment process that follows a sequential approach with distinct phases. From requiements, design and development. Where as, Agile is iterative and focused on incremental and collaboration. Agile is fexible to change while waterfall is not.

Waterfall is better for an individual working on a project that does not require teams , while Agile is appropriate for large teams or dynamic teams.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
- responsible for writing the code and developing the software solutions

A Quality Assurance Engineer
- Ensures the software quality by making plans for design and testing.

A Project manager
-Oversees the planning , implementation and deployment of the software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is important for Writing , debugging and testing the code like Visual studio, sublime and eclipse
VCS is important for tracking changes to the source code and cordinating with team memebers when changess are made. Some of the VCS include ; Git, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing requirements- the user needs might change during the development which can delay the project delivery timelines.
- Tight Deadlines- short timelines can compromise on the quality
- Technical debt- Developers might cut shortcut and in future will increase the maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing  an individual component of a software, like a specific module.
Integration Testing i stesting the innteractions between different modules, subsystems or one system and the other.
System Testing is testing the entie system.
Acceptanc testing is testing whether the software solution meets the end uswer requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt Engineering is the crafting of wuestion or statements in order to get the best possible reponses from AI models.

Promt enginnering is important because it helps in making sthe statements or questions clear, and specific that AI models understands what exactly you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Write a code for a calculator

Better Promt: Write lines of code for a calcultor using python, with ability to do the following functions; Addition. subtraction, Division and Multiplication.

Improved promt is more effective because the AI model will provide a specific response.
